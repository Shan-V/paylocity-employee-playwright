## Installation

To get started with this project, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shan-V/paylocity-employee-playwright.git
cd paylocity-employee-playwright
npm install
```

## Project Structure

- **`common/`**: Contains shared modules such as fixtures, pages, and utilities.
  - **`fixtures/pageWithAuth.ts`**: Fixture for handling authentication.
  - **`pages/portal/paylocityBenefitsDashboard.ts`**: Page object model for the Paylocity Benefits Dashboard.
  - **`utils/`**: Utility modules including logging (`Logger.ts`) and session management (`SessionManager.ts`).

- **`logs/`**: Directory for storing log files.
- **`playwright-report/`**: Directory for Playwright HTML reports.
- **`setup/`**: Scripts for session setup, such as `session-setup.ts`.
- **`tests/`**: Test cases, such as `add-new-employee.spec.ts`.
- **`playwright.config.ts`**: Configuration for Playwright, including test settings and projects.

## Running Tests

You can run the tests in both headless and headed modes. The following npm scripts are available:

### Default (Headed) Mode

```bash
npm test
```

## Test Scenarios

The test suite currently includes the following scenarios:

- **Positive Test**: Add a new employee with valid details (e.g., David Johns with 1 dependent).
- **Negative Test**: Attempt to add an employee with an excessive number of dependents (e.g., 33).
- **Negative Test**: Attempt to add an employee with an invalid number of dependents (e.g., -1).

Each scenario validates the application's response, ensuring correct behavior under various conditions.

## Configuration

The Playwright configuration is defined in `playwright.config.ts`:

- **Parallel Execution**: Tests run fully in parallel.
- **Retries**: Configurable retry logic for handling flaky tests.
- **Projects**: Different configurations for setup and testing environments (e.g., `chromium` with and without a headless mode).
- **Trace**: Tracing is enabled on the first retry to capture detailed execution logs for debugging.

## Customizing Username and Password

If you want to run the tests using your own username and password, you will need to update the credentials in the `SessionManager.ts` file. This file is responsible for managing the authentication process during the tests.

### How to Update Credentials

1. **Locate the File**: Navigate to the `SessionManager.ts` file in your project directory:
   ```bash
   common/utils/SessionManager.ts
   ```

2. **Update the Credentials**:
   - Open the `SessionManager.ts` file.
   - Look for the method named `loginAndSaveAuthState`. This method currently uses hardcoded credentials for logging in.
   - Replace the existing username and password with your own.

Hereâ€™s the relevant code snippet that you need to update:

```typescript
private async loginAndSaveAuthState(page: Page): Promise<void> {
    const loginPage = new LoginPage(page);
    await loginPage.login("TestUser407", "k*@#^00}$5x*"); // Replace these credentials with your own
    await page.waitForURL(/\/Prod\/Benefits/);
    logger.info('Login successful.');
}
```

- **`"TestUser407"`**: Replace this with your username.
- **`"k*@#^00}$5x*"`**: Replace this with your password.

## Logging & Reporting

- **Logs**: Stored in the `logs/` directory. Each test suite generates a unique log file.
- **Reports**: Playwright generates HTML reports after test execution, accessible via the `playwright-report/` directory.
